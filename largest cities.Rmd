```

Write down the name of a country and its largest city, one after the other. Hidden in this string, in consecutive letters, is another country's capital (in six letters)? What is it?
The first country's capital and the second country's largest city share the same two starting letters.

Edit: Islamabad and Istanbul.
A: PakistAN KARAchi --> ANKARA (Turkey)

```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
